# portfolio

Short intro into project
This is my portfolio website which is going to show the projects I have done on the _nology course.
At present the projects section just contains some websites I have made over the past year to fill space. 
I will update it as I learn more on the course, like adding to the Skills section for example
I wanted to animate the butterfly but I'm not sure how to yet, will need to work on this bit!
I've put in a Bootstrap nav bar, and used CSS Grid for the projects section with Flexbox for the rest of the website layout
